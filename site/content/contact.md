        Premium Auslese is a German style wine that was first perfected by the
        founder of Smoky Hill, whose wife’s roots can be traced back to Treir,
        Germany.  “Premium Auslese” means late harvest, pronounced “owslaysa”.


        Produced from Kansas grown grapes, this late harvest semi-sweet white
        wine can be enjoyed year round with your favorite grilled pork, chicken
        or barbeque dishes.  Best served well chilled.​
