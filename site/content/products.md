        Vidal Blanc is crafted particularly as a great transition wine. The
        natural fruit flavors appeal to those who enjoy sweet wines, but is dry
        enough to appeal to lovers of Riesling and Chardonnay. This wine has a
        floral aroma followed by a crisp, fruity palate and long finish making
        it a perfect complement to any summer fare.
